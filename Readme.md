In this project, a constraint optimization approach based on Augmented Lagrangian (ALM) has
been used to reconstruct the X-ray CT image from a limited number of projections. The constructed
ALM technique has been used to address the image reconstruction job, which has been formulated
as a regularized (based on wavelet tight frame regularization) constraint optimization problem. The
implementation findings indicate that ALM may efficiently converge to the optimum point and produce
a reconstructed image with minimal mean-squared error while strongly preserving the constraint with the
right selection of hyper-parameters. Furthermore, proper selection of post-processing on the reconstructed
image can prove to be very effective for quality enhancement of the reconstruction
